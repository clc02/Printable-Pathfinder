# Printable-Pathfinder
A project turning the openly available pathfinder books from the paizo website into printer friendly .odt files.

Help is always appreciated
Tools:
OpenOffice Writer, using the section feature to allow two columns of text on pages
Any PDF reader
A few freely available fonts: Gandhi-Sans, Gandhi-Serif, and Oleandra
Oleandra - Fancy text, Gandhi-Serif - Most text, Gandhi-Sans - Text presented in tables
The PDFs themselves: http://zaffudo.com/sebe/Pathfinder%20Roleplaying%20Game/

Formatting:
Text present in two columns on the source PDF are copied into a two column format with a .1" spacing.
New paragraphs are marked with a single line break and two space indent
  E.G. In this manner
Sections that have a line under the section title are accomplished by filling the line with spaces and underlining the entirety of the line.
Words should be bolded and italicized as they are in the source book.

The following I consider highest priority, as the traditional bare minimum to run a game, but feel free to contribute to whatever you wish to.
PZO1110 Core Rulebook (5th Printing).pdf
PZO1114 GameMastery Guide (2nd printing).pdf
PZO1112 Bestiary (3rd printing).pdf

# Printable-Pathfinder
A project turning the openly available pathfinder books from the paizo website into printer friendly .odt files.

Help is always appreciated


## Tools:

- OpenOffice Writer, using the section feature to allow two columns of text on pages
- Any PDF reader
- A few freely available fonts: Gandhi-Sans, Gandhi-Serif, and Oleandra
- Oleandra - Fancy text, Gandhi-Serif - Most text, Gandhi-Sans - Text presented in tables
- The PDFs themselves: http://zaffudo.com/sebe/Pathfinder%20Roleplaying%20Game/

## Formatting:
- Text present in two columns on the source PDF are copied into a two column format with a .1" spacing.
- New paragraphs are marked with a single line break and two space indent
- Sections that have a line under the section title are accomplished by filling the line with spaces and underlining the entirety of the line, and written in 18pt bold Oleandra
- Smaller sections are 14pt, Bold and Oleandra
- Words should be bolded and italicized as they are in the source book.

## Priorities

The following I consider highest priority, as the traditional bare minimum to run a game, but feel free to contribute to whatever you wish to.

- PZO1110 Core Rulebook (5th Printing).pdf
- PZO1114 GameMastery Guide (2nd printing).pdf
- PPZO1112 Bestiary (3rd printing).pdf
